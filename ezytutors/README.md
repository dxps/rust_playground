```

2. From a web browser access the following URI:

```
http://localhost:3000/health
```

You should see a web page displayed with the following message:

### Using `tutor-nodb`

1. From a terminal window, run from workspace root:

```
cargo run -p tutor-nodb --bin tutor-service
```

2. From a new terminal window, run the following command to post a few courses:

```
curl -X POST localhost:3000/courses/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"tutor_id":1, "course_name":"Hello , my first course !"}'
curl -X POST localhost:3000/courses/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"tutor_id":1, "course_name":"Hello , my second course !"}'
