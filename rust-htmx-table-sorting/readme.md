A nice and quick implementation using HTMX w/ Rust, Axum (as back-end) and Maud (as templating engine for server-side rendering).

Found it presented in [this article](https://dev.to/vladkens/table-sorting-and-pagination-with-htmx-3dh8?context=digest) and copied (as a reference) from [here](https://github.com/vladkens/blog_code/tree/main/rust-htmx-table-sorting).
