## A journey into Rust Programming Language

The purpose of this repo is to collect in one place all the concepts, abstractions, and features of this wonderful language.

state: WIP

## Run

All the examples are designed (in the code, including `fn main()`) and declared (in `Cargo.toml` file) as binaries, therefore these can also be run using `cargo run --bin`. Example:

```shell
$ cargo run --bin ownership_ex1
```
